Java Bytecode Snapshot Vm and Symbolic Executor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lexicalscope/svm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lexicalscope/svm)
=========================================

If you would like to help out, please contact me or just fork and get going.

Particularly anyone who wants to get more of the bytecode instructions implemented, or who wants to help with java standard library compatiblity, or work on performance/scalability.

I do not plan to add multi-threading support in the near future.

It currently uses microsoft z3, which you will have to download and build. You need the unstable branch for the Java API.
